# 20Time
This project is a 20 Time project which means that it will be worked on one day a week in class with additional work happening outside of class.

The plan:
Research, create, and demonstrate a program that takes text files and looks at the patterns, then after training makes a similar example based off the content it has seen. Document progress on the program through Github.

Why I chose this topic:
I really enjoy programming and self teaching myself how to make different things. Machine learning is fascinating to me, and this is an opportunity to further my own abilities. Additionally, this project can tell us a lot about a group of content and the patterns we may not notice ourselves.
